# SparkCAM
Sensor enabled (temp and humidity)  motion sensor security camera based on a Raspberry Pi
Hacked script reads sensors from a Raspberry PI GPIO, snaps a photo from the on-board pi camera and overlays the sensor info and writes captured photo to WebRoot
on the Raspberry Pi - all based on motion it detects from motion sensor on the Pi. 
It also sends the captured photo up to a Cisco Webex Team room (used to be call Cisco Spark)
